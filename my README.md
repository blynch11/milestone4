## Background ##
During the Covid-19 Pandemic many of us were left without a place to workout, relieve stress and work on our personal fitness goals due to gym closures. To fill this void peoeple took to youtube, tv and other sources to get their workout fix. This showed people that they do not need to be in the gym to achieve their workout goals, and can instead achieve them at home, with the correct guidance and tools. Power Fitness will provide people with tailored workout plans, nutritional advice and products, home gym equipment and more.

Power Fitness will also provide people with stylish gym wear that can be worn during workouts, or when out and about.

Power Fitness has simply been created for the purposes of the ms4 assignment.
